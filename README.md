## DAT153 oblig 2

#### Test 1 - testMainActivity
This test launches the main activity, then it selects the quiz and clicks the first answer button. 
✅

#### Test 2 - testQuizActivity
This test launches the quiz and selects one right and one wrong answer. Then it checks that the score is correctly updated.
✅

#### Test 3 - testDatabase
This test launches the database and adds an entry using intent stubbing. The image it uploads is a sample.jpg from the drawable folder. The test then checks that the database has updated the amount of entries.
✅

### Potential tests
We could have tested the following functionality:
- Sorting -> making sure that the database view is always sorted alphabetically, and that when the sorting button is clicked, it is reversed
- Deleting -> making sure that deleting entries both remove the entry from the database, but also updates the view and the game logic
- Difficulty -> making sure that the difficulty switch makes it so that the correct difficulty intent is passed on to the quis app
- Timer -> making sure that the timer is always the same length, even though the phone is rotated, you pull down the menu, etc...

### ADB
We believe that Gradle uses the following adb commands to install and run tests on a phone/emulator, although we werent able to find them in either the logs or the decoded APK:

**adb install** - This command installs the APK file generated by Gradle onto the connected device/emulator.
**adb shell am instrument** - This command starts the instrumentation tests on the device/emulator. It takes a number of arguments, including the package name of the app, the name of the test runner, and the name of the test package to be run.
**adb shell am start** - This command starts the main activity of the app on the device/emulator. It is typically used to launch the app and perform UI tests.
**adb shell am force-stop** - This command stops the app on the device/emulator. It is often used to reset the app state before running tests.
**adb logcat** - This command allows you to view the logs generated by the app and the device/emulator during test execution. It is useful for debugging test failures and other issues.
